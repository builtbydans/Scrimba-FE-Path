**display: block**; - This ensures that the element is stacked in a vertical alignment.
                  The default CSS for elements is block display.

**Margin** - We can use this in order to maipulate the space around an element. A neat
         trick to center objects is to ensure the margin-left and margin-right are auto.

**Dev-Tools** - We can Inspect Element using the in-browser dev tools to look at the box
            model of an element.

**Content** - In the box model view in Dev Tools, the inner-most box is the 'Content'.
          The first value is the width and the second value is the height in which
          the content has been allocated.

**Height** - Some browsers do not honour the height property. Instead, we should use
         the line-height CSS property as this is more universally accepted.

**Buttons** - By default, buttons are display: inline;

**Flex Box** - A flexbox container always consists of a container and it's direct children.
               To make any container flex box, we use display: flex;.

**justify-content** - When a container is flex-box, we can then use this property to manipulate
                      the positioning of the flex content on a page.
