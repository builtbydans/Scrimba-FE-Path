display: block; - This ensures that the element is stacked in a vertical alignment.
                  The default CSS for elements is block display.

margin - We can use this in order to manipulate the space around an element. A neat
         trick to center objects is to ensure the margin-left and margin-right are auto.

Dev-Tools - We can Inspect Element using the in-browser dev tools to look at the box
            model of an element.

Content - In the box model view in Dev Tools, the inner-most box is the 'Content'.
          The first value is the width and the second value is the height in which
          the content has been allocated.

Height - Some browsers do not honour the height property. Instead, we should use
         the line-height CSS property as this is more universally accepted.
