**File-Paths** - When using the <img> tag, the src needs to follow the absolute path
                 to the image.

**alt attribute** - The alt attribute is necessary for accessibility. This is a description
                    that is relative to the image for screen-readers. The alt tag also
                    acts as a fallback if the image render fails. The alt tag also provides
                    important meta-data for good SEO.

**Flex-Box** - Flexbox will only affect the direct children into columns.

**Utility Classes** - A class for a single CSS property.

**DRY** - Dont Repeat Yourself - write less code and be more efficient.

**CSS Inheritance** - There are certain properties that can be inherited using the body tag.
                      This means setting this property in the body tag will affect any that
                      are set in their own individual elements.

**Font Basics** - Web safe fonts are fonts that pre-programmed into your browser. Unlike
                  other fonts which are imported etc. where the client will have to wait for
                  the server to send back the font, web safe fonts are already pre-rendered.
