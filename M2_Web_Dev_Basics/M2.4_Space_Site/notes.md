**Background-Image** - The URL() function can take an external email or can point to
                       a relative file in your codebase.

**Background-Size** - Use background-size: cover; to fit the background image as the same
                      width as the container i.e. the window.

**Google Fonts** - We can link the Google fonts by importing their <link> elements directly into
                   our HTML. We then reference the font name as per the set naming conventions.

**Inherit** - We can use the 'inherit' value to inherit the CSS attribute from the body tag.

**Font-Face** - You can locally add font-faces into your file system and use the @font-face rule
                in CSS. You then use the src: url() function and give the font-family a name. You
                can then call this font in your CSS as normal.

**Span Tags** - They allow us to manipulate specific inline-content using styling.

**Classes vs ID** - We refer to an ID using # in our CSS. The reason why we choose ID's is when
                    we are certain that the element will be unique and only used once.

**Text Shadow** - The text shadow uses the offset of the horizontal line first i.e. pushing it
                  and the second value is the vertical alignment i.e. pushing it down. By adding a minus you will reverse the direction. You can add a third value which will introduce a blur.
