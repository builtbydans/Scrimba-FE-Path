**Align-Items** - justify-content will align the items on the horizontal axis but align-items will align
                  the items on the vertical axis.

**Flex-Direction** - By changing the flex direction of a block, you have to factor in how the justify-content
                     and align-items will now change depending on which axis the direction is placed at.
