**Console Log** - In order to log any part of your JavaScript to the console,
                  you need to use the console.log() function.

**Block Scope** - let variables are block scoped.

**Datatypes: String** - When you have a string and a number datatype, the string
                        will always override as the dominant datatype i.e. in string
                        interpolation etc.

**textContent** - Unlike innerText, textContent will respect human-readable elements
                  i.e. spaces and render them.
