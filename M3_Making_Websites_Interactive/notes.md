**Console Log** - In order to log any part of your JavaScript to the console,
                  you need to use the console.log() function.

**Block Scope** - let variables are block scoped.

**Datatypes: String** - When you have a string and a number datatype, the string
                        will always override as the dominant datatype i.e. in string
                        interpolation etc.

**textContent** - Unlike innerText, textContent will respect human-readable elements
                  i.e. spaces and render them.

***===*** - Triple equal is a strict equality operator. It will check that the datatype
            matches. == ignores datatypes and will do type conversion.

**querySelector** - Unlike getElementById, querySelector allows us to select both class
                    names and ID's, however we have to explicitly type these out.

**Arrays** - Whilst Arrays are zero-indexed, the .length property is not zero-indexed.

**.push()** - Will add items to the end of an array.

**.pop()** - Will remove the last item in the array. LIFO.

**For Loop** - The three conditions in a for loop are: start initialisation, end param and step size.

**Return** - In order for a function to return a value to the program, you have to return variables using the 'return' keyword.
